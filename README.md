## Variables 

### Declare a variable "favoriteColor" using the const keyword

### Declare a variable "petName" using the let keyword

### In your own words, when you should use a let vs const keywords?

### In your own words, what is 'truthiness' in JS?

--- 

## Control Flow 
 
```js
let age = prompt("Enter Your Age")
/*
 * Create an conditional block that displays different 4 messages based on the entered age

    - bonus: provide an alternative message if the answer is not a number
*/
```
---

### Count down using a for loop
```js
/*
 * HW Review:
 *
 * Create a loop that counts down from 10 to 0, printing each number (including 10 and 0).
*/

function forLoopCountDown() {
  // YOUR CODE HERE
}

// forLoopCountDown()
```
--- 

### Count down from 10 a while loop
```js
/*
 * Create a loop that counts down from 10 to 0, printing each number (including 10 and 0).
 */

function whileLoopCountDown() {
  // YOUR CODE HERE
}

// whileLoopCountDown()
```
---


## Array Review

```js
/*
 * Create an array that contains all the colors of the rainbow (as strings)
 */

const rainbow;
 // YOUR CODE HERE 

```

```js
/*
 * Use the length of the array below to retrieve the second to last item.
*/

const array4 = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"];
 // YOUR CODE HERE 

```
--- 
### Modifying array values directly

```js
const starWars = ["Han", "C3PO", "R2D2", "Luke", "Leia", "Anakin"];
/*
 * Use the the array length property to change "Anakin" to "Darth Vadar".
*/


 // YOUR CODE HERE 
 
```
---
### Array Traversal
 
```js
const starWars = ["wild","ratty","available","crack","straw","silk","wing","picture","greedy","far-flung","groan","rifle"];

/*
 * Use a for loop to iterate log every string in the array

 bonus - create a new array from words shorter than 6 characters 

*/

 // YOUR CODE HERE 
 
```
---

## Object Review

 
```js
const SEIStudent = {};

/*
 * Populate the General Assembly SEI Student with the following properties:
 * ID - Integer
 * name - String
 * age - Float/Integer
 * location - String
 * enrolled - Boolean
 * previousJobs - Array
 * interests - Object with properties:
 *      hobbies - Array
 *      canCook - Boolean
 *      favoriteShows - []  
 *      favoriteVideogame - String
*/

 // YOUR CODE HERE 
 
```
